# movie-recommendation-system
In this project, we recommend movies to the users based on the history of their 
personalized searches and reviews. Both people and online streaming services need a 
user based personalized movie recommendation system which helps in analyzing the 
interests of each individual and recommends the best movies suited to them. The 
approach used for building the movie recommendation system is content-based filtering. 
As we know that content-based filtering analyses the user's past behavior and 
recommends items similar to it based on the parameters considered. In this Content-based
movie recommender system gives their recommendations based on attributes like 
Ratings, Genre, and Casts.

# cosine distance
Cosine distance (also known as cosine similarity) is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space, such as a high-dimensional vector space. It's commonly used to compare the similarity or dissimilarity between two vectors based on the angle between them, rather than their absolute magnitudes.

Cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors and is often used in various applications, including text analysis, recommendation systems, image processing, and more.
