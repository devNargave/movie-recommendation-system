# movie-recommendation-system
In this project, we recommend movies to the users based on the history of their 
personalized searches and reviews. Both people and online streaming services need a 
user based personalized movie recommendation system which helps in analyzing the 
interests of each individual and recommends the best movies suited to them. The 
approach used for building the movie recommendation system is content-based filtering. 
As we know that content-based filtering analyses the user's past behavior and 
recommends items similar to it based on the parameters considered. In this Content-based
movie recommender system gives their recommendations based on attributes like 
Ratings, Genre, and Casts.
